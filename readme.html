This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

Lombardo J, Harrington MA (2016) Non-reciprocal mechanisms of up- and
down-regulation of spinal motoneuron excitability by modulators of
KCNQ/Kv7 channels. J Neurophysiol

These NEURON models were contributed by J Lombardo and includes
contributions from previous models available in modeldb (see paper for
details).

Usage:

Either auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract this archive
and compile the mod files, and then start with

nrngui mosinit.hoc

on the command line for unix/linux or double click on the mosinit.hoc
in file explorer for
mswin. See <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.html">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.html</a>
for more details on downloading and running the model.

After the model starts click on one of the buttons in the window
<img src="./buttons.png" alt="Set and run window" width="150">
and then the run button.

The CTRL, gKM=0, RETIGABINE, buttons produce (respectively)
<img src="./ctrl.png" alt="CTRL figure" width="550">
<img src="./gKm0.png" alt="gKM=0 figure" width="550">
<img src="./retigabine.png" alt="retigabine figure" width="550">
similar to Figure 4 in the paper.

XE991 produces the following:
